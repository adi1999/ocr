Introducing a powerful OCR Github repository that utilizes the state-of-the-art YOLOV4 algorithm as a text detector and Tesseract as a text recognizer. This repository offers exceptional performance for real-world applications and is perfect for anyone looking to extract text from images quickly and accurately.

By using YOLOV4 as a text detector, this OCR algorithm can accurately locate and crop text regions from images. These cropped images are then passed to Tesseract, a powerful OCR engine, which can recognize text accurately and efficiently. The combination of YOLOV4 and Tesseract offers unparalleled accuracy and speed in text detection and recognition.

This OCR repository is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use, with detailed instructions on how to install and use the algorithm. It is also open-source, so users can modify and improve the algorithm to fit their specific needs.

Overall, this OCR repository is a must-have for anyone looking to extract text from images quickly and accurately. Its use of the YOLOV4 algorithm and Tesseract OCR engine make it a powerful tool for real-world applications, and its user-friendly design and open-source nature make it accessible to everyone.
